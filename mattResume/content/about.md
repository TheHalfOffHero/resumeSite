# My Name is Matt and I'm a *Devops Engineer*

I have a great love for all things tech. From my earliest years I've sought to learn as much as possible about the systems and services that seem to shape life in the 20th century. Given this fascination with technology it only seemed to make sense for me to pursue a career in IT. I'm truly blessed that each day I get to wake up and work in such a fast paced and interesting field.




Education
---------

   **Computer Science**; Purdue University (Fort Wayne, IN)

   **Biology**; Indiana University (Bloomington, IN)

Experience
----------

**Associate DevOps Engineer:**

As an associate DevOps Engineer for [Mesh Systems](https://meshsystems.com/) Mesh Systems I worked primarily with Azure and Azure DevOps, Writing IAC with Bicep/Terraform and building CI/CD pipelines. I also spent time scripting out solutions in Powershell and Bash as well as collaborating with development and product team members to help deliver features to our clients.

**IT Project Engineer:**

As an IT Projects Engineer for Bradford-Scott Data Corp also known as [Sharetec](https://www.sharetec.com/). I worked as an IT specialist working to deploy our hosted core banking solution for our customers. This entailed a great deal of work with Hypervisors, Linux (RedHat/CentOS), Windows, and Networking. I also worked to script out repetitive tasks in either bash or powershell as necessary. 

Technical Experience
--------------------

## Homelab
:   I maintain a homelab that consists of a small collection of network equipment and a proxmox hypervisor. On my home server I like to spin up hosted services to play and learn with. Currently I have a docker host running portainer with an assortment of containers, pihole and unbound for dns, plex, and a nas for long term redundant storage. I also have a kubernetes cluster up and running that can be brought up and down whenever with terraform.  


## Programming Languages/DevOps Tools

:  **Python:** I try to do most of my side projects using python if possible. I spent a great deal of time compiled languages in college so python, with its simple syntax was a breath of fresh air. While I'm not a master I'm capable enough to work out solutions when reference material is available. 

:  **Bash:** I used bash the most in my time at Sharetec. While I don't really consider it a programming language I use it whenever I need to automate tasks in a Linux environment.

:   **Powershell** In the same vein as Bash, I have primarily used powershell to script out tasks normally done in windows. We often use powershell to query Azure and Azure DevOps to generate reporting for our teams at Mesh to use.

:   **Terraform and Bicep** I have used both Terraform and Bicep to build infrastructure. I use Terraform at home when working on my homelab or personal projects and I primarily use Microsoft's Bicep to build Azure infrastructure at work.

:   **Microsoft Azure** At Mesh Systems we are a Microsoft shop, so all of our infrasture is hosted primarily in Azure.

:   **Azure Pipelines** Azure pipelines is our defacto way of performing CI/CD for our projects at Mesh Systems.

:  **Kubernetes** I have a small cluster running in my homelab. I have done some basic work with AKS at mesh and services that abstract away portions of kubernetes such as Azure Container Apps

:   **Git** Any project I do, be it at work or at home, is done using a VCS. At work we use Azure DevOps but at home I prefer GitHub.

:   **Docker** At home I manage a portainer instance that hosts a number of services. Each is defined in a docker compose stack.

:   Basic knowledge of **Go**,**Java**, **C#**, **.NET**, **K8s**

Certifications
